This code borrows heavily from a similar plugin created by Kevin Clair for DU.


# Local

We use local plugins to customize the marc export beyond what ArchivesSpace provides by default.

In each section of the code, changes made by the plugins are commented with descriptions of what each change sets out to do.

## Backend customizations

The backend customizations override the default MARC export for Resources, to make local customizations to leader and control fields.
